## School District Data Analysis
Welcome to the School District Data Analysis project. In this project, we'll be working with various datasets related to the school district, including student data, school data, and test scores. Our goal is to derive insights from the data to help inform strategic decisions regarding school budgets and priorities.

## Analysis Tasks
Using the provided csv data for schools and students we are able to analyze the data and get the following results for the summary of each:

# Student Summary
 1)Total Number of Unique Schools
 
 2)Total Number of Students
 
 3)Total Budget
 
 4)Average Math Score
 
 5)Average Reading Score
 
 6)Percentage of Students Who Passed Math
 
 7)Percentage of Students Who Passed Reading
 
 8)Percentage of Students That Passed Both Math and Reading
 
 9)Creating a New DataFrame - District Summary

# School Summary
 1)School Type
 
 2)Total Student Count
 
 3)Per Capita Spending
 
 4)Average Test Scores
 
 5)Number of Schools with Math Scores of 70 or Higher
 
 6)Number of Schools with Reading Scores of 70 or Higher
 
 7)Schools Passing Both Math and Reading
 
 8)Passing Rates


## Conclusion
This data analysis provides valuable insights into school performance, budget allocation, and other factors that can help guide decisions in the school district. The generated DataFrames store various metrics, and these insights can serve as a foundation for making informed decisions about school budgets and priorities.
