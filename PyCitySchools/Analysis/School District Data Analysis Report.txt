School District Data Analysis Report

School Type Analysis:

There are a total of 15 schools in the district, including both charter and district schools.
Charter schools tend to have higher average math and reading scores even with a lower overall budget and per student budget compared to district schools which have a higher budget. They also have significantly higher passing rates in math, reading, and in general overall.
District schools, on the other hand, have larger student populations, but they tend to have lower average scores and passing rates.

School Size Analysis:

The analysis indicates that smaller-sized schools with fewer than 1,000 students tend to have higher average math and reading scores and higher passing rates.
Medium-sized schools with 1,000 to 2,000 students also perform well in terms of average scores and passing rates.
Larger schools with more than 2,000 students have lower average scores and passing rates.
Smaller and medium-sized schools tend to provide a better learning environment, leading to higher academic performance and passing rates. Large schools face challenges in maintaining high standards.
